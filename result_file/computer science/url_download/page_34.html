<dd>And I think it should go right back. This article doesn't even have a proper introduction, and now the <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a> article is unbalanced and missing relevant content that should at least be summarized there. There is a lot more to editing articles than cut'n'paste. And why isn't this called "history of personal computerS"? There is more than one, you know. --<a href="/wiki/User:Wtshymanski" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtshymanski" title="User talk:Wtshymanski">talk</a>) 02:24, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

<dd>The History section was way too long for an artice thats main topic is not history. It is logical, that after such a move it will be necessary to write new History section (which I actually said in <a href="/wiki/Talk:Personal_computer#Separating_History_into_another_article" title="Talk:Personal computer">Talk:Personal_computer</a>). I named the page in singular, because the original article is in singular too. I am placing Intro-rewrite template here to satisfy your lead request.--<a href="/wiki/User:Kozuch" title="User:Kozuch">Kozuch</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kozuch" title="User talk:Kozuch">talk</a>) 10:26, 7 March 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The result was massive sales of the 64, albeit at almost no profit."... - entire paragraph is <big>NOT TRUE</big>! There is no reference for claims in that paragraph. Not single one! Here is reference about stock price from 1983.: "Which is what he did in those early years for computers, leading Commodore to $700 million in sales in fiscal 1983 and $88 million in profits. At its peak price in those days, the stock that Tramiel had sold in 1962 at a price of $2.50 a share was up to $1,200, and his 6.5% slice of the company was worth $120 million." <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.commodore.ca/history/people/jack_tramiel_starting_over.htm">http://www.commodore.ca/history/people/jack_tramiel_starting_over.htm</a> If 6.5% worth $120 millions than market CAP of Commodore in 1983. was $1,846 millions! ...yes, he drove commodore out of business.

<dd>You can easy find Commodore earning during 80s by typing e.g. "commodore 1983 profit quarter" in Google. Here is link with "compiled" information: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/commodore-international">http://www.answers.com/topic/commodore-international</a><br /></dd>
<dd>1982: "reported profits of $40.6 million on sales of $304 million."<br /></dd>

<dd>1984: "fiscal year Commodore made $143 million and reported sales of $1.27 billion"<br /></dd>
<dd>1985: Commodore starts lose money: "The company lost $113 million in 1985"<br /></dd>
<dd>1986: "... and $127 million in 1986."<br /></dd>

<dd>now, when we have all this facts, do you still think that "The result was massive sales of the 64, albeit at almost no profit." is a fact??? it is a NONSENSE! this sentence is also untrue: "In the end even Commodore's own finances were crippled by the demands of financing the massive building expansion needed to deliver the machines, and Tramiel was forced from the company." how Commodore "finances were crippled"? by making profits with C64 sale? Commodore start to lose money as soon as demand for C64 start to fall down. <a href="/wiki/User:Calimero" title="User:Calimero">Calimero</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Calimero" title="User talk:Calimero">talk</a>) 10:24, 14 March 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First hack at fixing these problems. Deleted the duplicated breathless stuff about Time Magazine. Little bit of microcomputer phase 1974 through 1977 period. A well-equipped 1975 microcomputer had a teletype for input/output and mass storage, and might have had as much as 64 K of RAM. BYTE magazine appears. Altair begat the <a href="/wiki/S100" title="S100" class="mw-disambig">S100</a> bus. 8-inch mainframe floppy drives were harnessed to micros, which begat various disk operating systems and eventually CP/M. S100 boxes became commonplace for industrial and business applications until RAM became dense enough to make single-board computers practical. Years of struggle with the limitations of 8-bit 64 K address spaces which were never really intended for general purpose computing. Various multi-tasking business systems with multiple terminals and minimal proprietary networking. Computing power and mass storage were low, and expensive, but an S100 system with a local guru to run it was still cheaper than approaching IBM to automate your dental office or law practice. Computer stores popped up. But 1023 different 5 1/4 inch floppy disk formats made stocking software painful. All this needs to be researched and put in the article. We need references. And pictures. The pre-1984 history of personal computers is much more interesting than the post 1984 period, in my opinion. --<a href="/wiki/User:Wtshymanski" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtshymanski" title="User talk:Wtshymanski">talk</a>) 03:00, 6 June 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OH, and we've come full circle. First you had to approach the mainframe priests to use the Big Iron and every CPU cycle had to have an accounting code. Then for a while you could buy a desktop and snub the data center guys. Now the desktop is networked and again so hard to use that you need another priesthood to keep Windows alive and again every page you print needs an accounting code (at least at the office). Running a network depersonalizes your personal computer. --<a href="/wiki/User:Wtshymanski" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtshymanski" title="User talk:Wtshymanski">talk</a>) 03:13, 6 June 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You've got to talk about the Elder Days. We don't want people thinking Bill Gates invented the PC in 1981 to improve sales of Windows. My literary skills are not up to describing the raw thrill I had walking up to a PDP 11/45 in 1979 and having it at my complete disposal - a personal computer, indeed, but no "microcomputer" or "home computer". Imagine the feelings of the first buyers behind the wheel of a Model T - no more waiting for the train! You've got to retain some of that feeling of the impact personal computers had - only a very few people had the experience in the early days, but now it's so commonplace that no-one respects how magical it is. If the term "microcomputer" means anything at all, then this mumblety-mumble gigahertz/gigabyte box sitting on my desk is every bit as much as microcomputer as an Altair. A "history of personal computers" articles that ignores the LINC and night-shift debugging is like a history of England that doesn't talk about anything before teh Beatles broke up. A dull recitation of catalog numbers is not history. --<a href="/wiki/User:Wtshymanski" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtshymanski" title="User talk:Wtshymanski">talk</a>) 21:40, 20 August 2008 (UTC)</p>

"it is important to include only those machines that had some sort of influence on the history and evolution of the PC." That's wildly inappropriate. The title is "History of personal computers." To restrict it to "the PC," which I assume means IBM's model 5150 and its architectural descendants, is like saying an article on music should only include events that influenced the history and development of rock. <s>As far as I know, the first significant use of the phrase "personal computer" was in Xerox's description of the Alto.</s> Well, I see the article mentions two earlier uses.

<p>I have twice removed the Heath section, arguing that it's influence on the history of computing is simply unimportant, and not worthy of inclusion here. The goal of any article on the Wiki is to balance the need for detail with the need to keep things short, so we don't overwhelm the reader. In this case, it is important to include only those machines that had some sort of influence on the history and evolution of the PC, which I argue the Heath did not. The section has been re-inserted both times now, so I guess it's time to bring the discussion here.</p>
<p>Wtshymanski, if you wish to argue that the Heath was <i>historically significant</i>, and deserves a three paragraph inclusion, you will need to demonstrate:</p>
<p>1) documentary evidence of widespread use in common magazines of the era, like Compute!, Creative Computing, Byte, Dr. Dobbs, etc. Not advertising, not reviews, articles about <i>using the machine</i>. <i>Thousands</i> of such articles exist for the Apple II, PET, Atari's, C64 and so on, which clearly demonstrates their importance at the time. In fact, all of these companies had <i>multiple'</i> magazines devoted to just these machines. Is there a wide body of general articles on the Heath? I don't recall any. I don't recall there ever being a magazine devoted to it either.</p>

<p>2) documentary evidence of the claim that the "The H-8 was successful". This article is about machines that sold millions of units, not thousands, and any "successful" claim will need to demonstrate those sorts of numbers.</p>
<p>3) a demonstration that any of features the Heath systems contributed to the history of computing. Was it the first widespread kit-built machine, like the Altair? Were they the least expensive, like the Sinclair? Most widely sold, like the C64? Best performing, like the Atari? Or perhaps they were the first all-in-one machines like the Sol-20 and PET? Or the first with built-in color support, like the Apple II? Does the Heath have any notable "first" or "best" at all? Anything that is even remotely historically notable?</p>
<p>I remember the H8 from when I was a kid, because I had a Heath catalog. I recall them being expensive, limited in terms of capability (no color, sound, etc.), being completely non-standard, and as a result, having a limited software library. At the time, I knew people with a wide variety of machines; various S-100 machines, Apples, PETs, Ataris, I even knew someone that had a CompuColor. I never met a single person that owned a Heath. Ever, even now 25 years later. The fact that they don't even have an article on the wiki is a good reason to believe their influence is extremely limited.</p>
<p>If you think they have any reason to be in an article on the history of personal computing, you're going to need something more than a personal opinion.</p>

<dd>This sort of astonishing truculence is the sort of thing that drives off editors.</dd>
<dd>In 1978 there *were* no million-selling machines! The Heath is notable because it was an instance of a (moderately well-known) electronics company trying to branch out into the developing field of personal computers. The stance that nothing before August 1981 matters does not well serve the article's claim to be a history of personal computers. It's precisely this era that *needs* to be documented on Wikipedia else people are going to come to think that Bill Gates invented the PC to improve the sales of Windows. In 1978 there *were* no standards - how can you criticize any machine for being "non-standard" in that era?</dd>
<dd>One difference I think from the S100 kits was that you could get everything (processor, terminal, disk drives, printer, software) from your friendly local Heath outlet and assemble it. Even Winnipeg had a Heathkit store back in the day. I would imagine most cities did not have a comparable presence for any other kit vendor. This is notable and different.</dd>
<dd>Also check out <a href="/wiki/Heathkit_H89" title="Heathkit H89" class="mw-redirect">Heathkit H89</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heath_H8" title="Heath H8" class="mw-redirect">heath H8</a> - at least someone thought these machines were notable enough to create redirects for them. Lack or presence of a Wikipedia article is not a reliable indicator of notability or importance. There's a powerful selection effect operating on Wikipedia which I think often seems to be written by bright teenagers with time on their hands, at least when it comes to technology related articles.</dd>
<dd>I didn't write the original text but I certainly think it needs to be retained in the article. Without pioneering companies there would not have been million-selling computers.</dd>
<dd>Please don't truncate the article - it's important for people to understand just how diverse things were in the 1977-1980 era - when there was no obvious one way to do a personal computer. --<a href="/wiki/User:Wtshymanski" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtshymanski" title="User talk:Wtshymanski">talk</a>) 17:16, 20 December 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur with user Wtshymanski!!! Maury repeatedly uses phrase "history of <b>computers</b>" I want to remind him and others that this is history of <b>personal</b> computers, in the generic sense. Maury also demands documentary citations, and yet immediately thereafter shares <b>his</b> undocumented experiences as if they were relevant! Maury, for one thing, Heathkit was marketed to adults (unlike other more educational items in the catalog). Apple II, although available earlier, wasn't very popular until after <a href="/wiki/VisiCalc" title="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a> became popular. There was also a large divide between West Coast and East Coast hobbyist computing at that time. For instance, professionals working around Route 128 and Boston used to call SCSI-"sexy," not "scuzzy." Geography might explain your ignorance of Heathkits. And as for "Was it the first widespread kit-built machine, like the Altair?" It was the FIRST AND ONLY kit-built machine for years. S-100 home computers weren't available as a "kit," yhat makes Heathkits notable. It is ridiculous to ask for magazines and articles. This is like asking for articles and widespread use of the Model-T in 1908. On the other hand, there are books and magazines about the HISTORY of personal computers which cover the Heathkit(and even the wider field of history of computers) I will certainly return with citations. <a href="/wiki/User:Cuvtixo" title="User:Cuvtixo">Cuvtixo</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cuvtixo" title="User talk:Cuvtixo">talk</a>) 21:08, 21 December 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The significance of the Heath H8 and H11, besides being very early entrants (1977) is that Heath was considered to be a "real" company of stature, not a tiny startup whose first product was a computer. Heath was known as the first company to market affordable <i>analog</i> computers, so its involvement with personal computers signaled that they had arrived. Perhaps people do not understand the reputation that Heathkits had among hobbyists. Yes, this is only my personal testimony, but I never used these machines and have no personal agenda in touting them. Nevertheless, I and everyone else was well aware of their influence at the time. Building a microcomputer was considered to be a risky business and not for the faint-of-heart. But Heathkit? Well, if they Heathkit was offering them, you knew they would work, that there was really was such a thing as a $500 computer. It had the same sort of effect on the hobbyist community that IBM's introduction of the PC would later have on the general public.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the H11 was the first 16-bit microcomputer.</p>
<p>Advertisements for the Heath H8 and H11 appeared in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.decodesystems.com/heathkit-ads.html">Interface Age</a>, a major trade publication.</p>
<p>The Heath H8 had a users' group.</p>
<p>"I don't recall there ever being a magazine devoted to it either." Of course not. In 1977, computer magazines... BYTE, Personal Computing, Dr. Dobbs' Journal... covered the whole world of computers. The single-brand magazine didn't emerge until several years later.</p>
<p>In 1979, BYTE devoted an article to "Building the Heath H8 computer," written by Dr. Paul R. Poduska.</p>

<p>Every one of these responses fails to address even one of the issues I mentioned. I was accused of "astonishing truculence" and it was claimed that I was confusing "computers" with "personal computers", and even the claim that I was stating that my personal memory was supposed to be some sort of evidence. In other words, lots of personal attack. Sadly, there was almost zero effort to address the actual issues. Let me address those attempts:</p>
<p>1) Cuvtixo article is exactly what I said was <i>not</i> the sort of thing that demonstrates importance. There were literally <i>hundreds</i> of computers released between 1976 and 1980 that would have articles of this sort. In order to demonstrate <i>historical importance</i>, one needs to demonstrated continued widespread coverage. The existence of entire commercial magazines (as opposed to newsletters) demonstrates this. Continued coverage in major generalist magazines, like the Atari columns in Creative Computing for instance, are also a good example. Can someone demonstrate <i>that</i>?</p>
<p>2) Advertisements absolutely <i>do not count</i>. Again, one can trivially find advertisements for hundreds of different machines that left absolutely no mark on the <i>history of personal computers</i>.</p>
<p>3) With the exception of the 16-bit claim, which is wrong (demonstrated here, no less), there hasn't been a single attempt to demonstrate any reason to believe this machine is in any way interesting to the <i>history of personal computer</i>s.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry... what was the earlier 16-bit microcomputer? If you're talking about the LSI-11, mentioned above, it was a board-level system, not a microcomputer, and it was an OEM product built into custom devices, whereas the H11 was a standalone computer. <a href="/wiki/User:Dpbsmith" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dpbsmith" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:39, 22 December 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think I <i>did</i> address a couple of your issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, I stated that the reason the Heath H8 is important in the history of personal computing is that <b>the entry of Heath Corporation into this market was perceived as legitimizing the microcomputer.</b> It will take some digging to establish this with references, but I've no doubt at all that it can be done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, you asked for "documentary evidence of the claim that the 'The H-8 was successful,'" so I provided a specific link to a specific recent article in <i>Make</i> magazine calling the H8, direct quote, "a huge Heathkit success."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Are they even real issues? I'm late to this discussion so please give me a link to the discussions on this talk page where consensus was reached on the following matters:
<ul>
<li>advertisements being irrelevant</li>
<li>a threshold of millions of sales being required for mention</li>
<li>the scope of the article being limited to machines that influenced the IBM PC (as opposed to "personal computers" in general).</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'll start at the end, because that most closely matches the crux of the issue I'm trying to get across. The argument I am making has nothing specifically to do with the Heath machines <i>per se</i>. It has to do with which machines should be in this article and which should not.</dd>
<dd>My concern is that unless we have some sort of objective filter this article will stop being about the <i>history of personal computers</i> and turn into <i>a list of every personal computer in history</i>. Those are two very different articles. Perhaps the Wiki should have an article listing every personal computer, perhaps not.</dd>
<dd>If this article is going to be about history, as the name implies, then we have to pick which machines will make it into that list based on their historical importance. What does it mean to be historically important? Well generally it means that they were considered important at the time, or at a later time when historians have had a chance to reflect on the era, or better yet, both.</dd>
<dd>Consider the Apple II. The Apple II is the topic of numerous historical works, perhaps hundreds of books and thousands of articles. It is mentioned in every major computing history article that covers the era or the development of personal computers. It is the topic of hundreds of thousands of web pages. Finding such evidence is trivially easy. Google turns up almost 1.5 MILLION hits on the Apple II. Google Books, which now includes many computer magazines of the era, turns up several thousand. Even in terms of fan base, there are thousands of web pages devoted to the machine. Clearly this machine is and was important. So by any measure, the Apple II is a must-have in any article that purports to record the <i>history of personal computers</i>.</dd>
<dd>Now let us examine the Heath H8. Google turns up a total of 926 hits. Of these, about a dozen are about the computer, and most of those are inside lists of old computers, or within lists of Heathkit products. There are a large number of hits about totally unrelated topics, like the biology of the heath, or the Heath government in the UK. Google Books turns up another 146 hits, of slightly higher quality. Examining these you will find that the vast majority are in product news sections, Heath's advertisements, or mentioned in passing. There are less than half a dozen hits that are articles about the machine itself, and they're all from when it was being introduced. There is not one single mention of these machines in historical articles like this page.</dd>
<dd>If this machine is historically important, as is being argued here, one will have to explain why it is that it has failed to make any mark in the historical record. I argue this is extremely good evidence that it's because it is <b>not historically important</b>. In spite of many arguments, you Dpbsmith, are the only one to even attempt to offer objective evidence. So what is that? A single mention in the <i>caption</i> of an image that states that the product was important <i>to Heath</i>. Under no circumstances would I consider that to be a statement of the machine's historical importance <i>in general</i>.</dd>
<dd>Now let's get to the specifics:
<dl>
<dd>Advertisements are irrelevant for <i>establishing historical importance</i>. Anyone can put an advertisement in a magazine. The fact that Heath widely advertised the machine does not, <i>by itself</i>, establish its historical importance. All it establishes is that Heath had an advertising budget.</dd>
<dd>I made no suggestion of some sort of threshold in sales as a filter to the list. Quite the opposite: some machines are historically important in spite of small numbers, like the Kenback or Alto. I fully support their inclusion, because one can trivially demonstrate their importance, like at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/?year=1971">Computer History Museum</a>. That said, huge sales numbers like the C64 guarantee it a place on the list. Certainly there's nothing historically notable about the Heath's sales, or at least no one's come up with any such argument. So <i>as an argument of its own</i>, it fails.</dd>
<dd>Historical importance can come about by being the "first" of something notable. In spite of asking, no one has managed to come up with a single "first" for any of these machines, with the possible exception of first 16-bit PC for the H11, except that other machines also used the LSI-11 (including DEC's own, starting in 1975/6), and one might be inclined to consider the DG Nova, many of which were used as PC's in spite of no one calling them that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Back to the point; historically important events are well recorded in the historical record. The Apple II is widely recorded in the historical record. The Heath machines are not. That implies that the Heath machines are not historically important. That implies it should be removed from the article, or as I said in the edit notes, removed to a footnote.</dd>
<dd>So again, if someone can offer any sort of substantiated argument that suggests the Heath was historically important enough to deserve a longer entry than the Apple II, I'm all ears. No one has come even close yet. All I get is people picking at my statements using too-literal interpretations of my words.</dd>

<dd>Obviously the Kenbak must go - no sales, no magazine, no standards, no software, no reviews, we never met anyone who owned one, no influence on the IBM PC.

<dl>
<dd>And one couldn't ask for a better example of my last point than this. Wtshymanski, the Kenback is historically important because it is widely commented on by historians. You have to meet at least one of the criterion for "importance", and the Kenback does that. So which one does the Heath H8 meet? Any of them?</dd>

<dd>Looking at the "Chronology" I listed above, in late 1977, we have Radio Shack opening its first all-computer store (they'd just sold 10,000 computers!), we have the first Apple II shipped to customers and Apple considering introducing a disk drive to their product line, we have Microsoft winning a lawsuit against PERTEC on the ownership of their BASIC, we have total shipments of "personal computers" of 48,000 - and we have Heath introducing the H8! With total sales of 48,000, obviously none of these machines were important (and they were all non-standard - none of them could run Vista or even Linux). No mention of the hundreds of other personal computers introduced in 1977, though. --<a href="/wiki/User:Wtshymanski" title="User:Wtshymanski">Wtshymanski</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wtshymanski" title="User talk:Wtshymanski">talk</a>) 15:12, 22 December 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="/wiki/User:Maury_Markowitz" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury Markowitz</a>: "My concern is that unless we have some sort of objective filter this article will stop being about the 'history of personal computers' and turn into 'a list of every personal computer in history.'" Let's cross that bridge when we come to it. If it becomes too listy, cut the descriptions down to single sentences and wedge 'em into a section entitled "list of historical personal computers" or something. I'm skeptical about the usefulness of "objective filters" in writing good articles about history. The filter should be the same filter we use throughout Wikipedia: if someone says a computer was important, and someone else challenges it, the person who says it was important has to come up with a rationale for why it's important, and some <i>reasonable</i> source citation that support the rationale. That's enough of a filter. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" title="Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect">WP:RS</a> is a good enough metafilter on the references themselves. By all means, keep 'em honest by insisting on a citation, but then let go, even if you don't personally agree with other editors' judgements.</p>
<p>At root, Wikipedia depends on consensus, good faith, and mutual respect between editors. Rules are useful in helping consensus gel, but there's no algorithm for what's "important" and what isn't, and editors must sometimes agree to disagree... and should err on the side of inclusion. <a href="/wiki/User:Dpbsmith" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dpbsmith" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:07, 22 December 2008 (UTC)</p>

<p>To see the evolution of the microcomputer in technical terms or sales figures is to miss most of the reasons why things happened as they did. What I'm about to say is in the nature of legitimate opinion that should be fairly noncontroversial to those who lived through the period. Obviously none of this can go in the article as it stands, but I'd submit that this can be a sort of rough outline of a part of the historical context, that could guide addition of properly referenced future content.</p>
<p>Personal computing is the confluence of several trends. One was the invention of personal computing itself, specifically the development of Whirlwind-style, short-word-length, integer-only computing, with direct console interaction... as opposed to Princeton-style computing. This largely took place <i>before</i> the development of the personal computer. PDP-1 hackers in the 1960s were already using computers for many mainstream PC purposes: word processing (Flexowriters were fully letter-quality printers, and TJ-1 justified the lines), impromptu numeric calculation (Expensive Desk Calculator), and games (Spacewar! and a flight simulator).</p>
<p>Another was a hobbyist community that knew about and wanted to engage in personal computing. People who knew <i>why</i> you would want a home computer. (Not for recipe planning!) If it hadn't been for the hobby community, microprocessors would have remained dedicated devices embedded in other systems. The idea of using a microprocessor as a general-purpose computer was not only alien to, it was actively resisted by the computing establishment. IBM and others knew quite consciously that microprocessors posed a threat to their established business and did their best to create artificial walls between microprocessors and computers.</p>
<p>An enormously important part of personal computer history was <b>the legitimization process.</b> This occurred rather quickly, over a period of perhaps five to ten years. Personal computers have now been legitimate for decades, but <b>IBM would never have produced a PC</b> if they hadn't been inexorably drawn into the riptide of legitimization.</p>
<p>The first hobbyist machines, including the Altair, were poorly engineered, if indeed they were engineered at all. Many did not work if peripherals were added to the bus. Many did not work even before they were added! The "kits" were not complete. The finished computers were science fair projects. Everyone knew some enthusiast who had a computer that worked fine except on whatever particular day you came to look at it.</p>
<p>Legitimization proceeded in stages. Heath was important precisely because of the enormous influence of the company and its catalogs. It did not legitimize the microcomputer to the public at large, but it legitimized it to the world of electronic hobbyists in general. It spread the idea beyond the wild-eyed Computer Faire types. Whether or not you actually bought one, if it was in the Heath catalog you knew that it was going to work, and had "adult supervision" and support behind it. The Heath was a breakthrough machine in the Altair, Cromemco, KIM-1 era.</p>
<p>The next stage was the fully-assembled, working unit. There were of course many but Apple was a standout here because of the general standard of fit and finish. (Of course, the first time I saw one, I was initially impressed by the brilliant thermal engineering that allowed it to operate reliably with no fan... only to discover quickly that what we had here was a total lack of thermal engineering, almost as it had never occurred to Apple that there was such a thing). This was the Apple, Commodore Pet, TRS-80 era. You could buy one and it would work, but what exactly could you do with one besides program it yourself, or type in programs from David Ahl's book and play "Hunt the Wumpus?" Of course the ads <b>implied</b> these were business machines, but they weren't.</p>
<p>The next stage was the emergence of Visicalc and the smuggling of these machines into businesses, a process that many will remember clearly. Purchase orders for Apples that not only avoided calling them computers but might have misleadingly called them "desktop calculators." Price negotiations and trying to convince dealers to cut a price to $4995 instead of $5025 because then it wouldn't need to go through the capital equipment committee.</p>
<p>The next stage was the mini and mainframe companies being dragged kicking and screaming into the picture. As I recall, several big companies... Xerox was one of them... introduced pedestrian computers all at about the same time, very uninteresting machines whose only significance was the big names on them. That is, the big companies, including IBM, realized that the pain of introducing microcomputers, while large, was going to be worse than the pain of missing the boat altogether. Then came 1981, and that strange machine with the deliberately underpowered processor, and schizophrenia about whether it should have a professional 80-column monochrome character generator or an Apple-like toy color graphics card... and the rest is familiar history. <a href="/wiki/User:Dpbsmith" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dpbsmith" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:51, 22 December 2008 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In spite of longish personal essays like this, and lots of similar statements above, none of the editors has managed to provide a single reference that does anything like back up the claims like "The Heathkits played a role in legitimizing the personal computer", or "signaled to the electronics and radio amateur community that the personal computer had arrived". Several other references have been added, but all they do is confirm the existence of the machines, or even less relevant, Heath.</dd>
