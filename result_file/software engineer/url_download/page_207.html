<p><b>The Institution of Engineers (India), 8 Gokhale Road, Kolkata (IEI)</b> is the National organization of Engineers in India. The Institution of Engineers (India) has over 0.5 million members in 15 engineering disciplines in 99 centers or chapters in India and overseas; it is the world's largest multi-disciplinary engineering professional society in engineering and technology world. The Institution of Engineers (India) was established in 1920 in Kolkata, West Bengal and is acclaimed to have pioneered non-formal education in Engineering. The Institution of Engineers (India) conducts an examination of its Associate Membership. This examination is considered to be on par with B.E. / B.Tech. When contemplated as an eligibility qualification to write competitive examinations like the Indian Civil Service, Indian Engineering Services, GATE, etc., and for employment in Government, public and private sectors in India. This qualification is recognized by Ministry of HRD, Government of India as equivalent to B.E./ B.Tech. The Institution of Engineers (India) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1935.

<li><b>The Associate Member of the Institution of Engineers India (AMIE)</b>: is a professional certification given by The Institution of Engineers (India). The qualification can be earned by passing Section A, Section B, Project Work and Laboratory experiments examination of the Institution. If an applicant passes both sections of the examination, he or she becomes an Associate Member of The Institution of Engineers (India) (AMIE). The Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development considers this qualification is equivalent to a degree in engineering. AMIE was earlier Grad IE (Bachelor's degree of Institution). Government of India in continuation to its earlier recognition, has recognized passing of sections A and B examinations as revised, conducted by The Institution of Engineers (India), as equivalent to bachelor's Degree in the appropriate branch of Engineering of the recognized universities in India and has notified in the gazette of India, Part I, Section I, dated February 11, 2006. AMIE is also recognized by UK-NARIC as British Bachelor's Honours degree. AMIE is also recognized by FCSA Foreign credential service of America as equivalent to Bachelor's degree in engineering. Minimum duration for passing both sections is 4 years, however professionals with 3 years polytechnic engineering can complete it in 3 years since they are exempted from certain examination papers of Section A. Project work and Laboratory experiments can be carried out only after clearing at least 5 subjects of Section B.</li>
<li><b>History</b>: IEI was established in 1920 in <a href="/wiki/Madras" title="Madras" class="mw-redirect">Madras</a> with Sir Thomas R. J. Ward as the founding president. It was formally inaugurated in 1921 by <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chelmsford" title="Lord Chelmsford" class="mw-redirect">Lord Chelmsford</a>, the then-Viceroy of British India. In 1935. IEI obtained the Royal Charter of Incorporation from King George V 'to promote and advance the science, practice and business of engineering'. Sir Thomas Guthrie Russell (President 1933–34) led the successful petition for a Royal Charter. <a href="/wiki/Harold_Williams_(British_Army_officer)" title="Harold Williams (British Army officer)">Harold Williams</a> served as President for a period in the 1950s. <a href="/wiki/L_V_Muralikrishna_Reddy" title="L V Muralikrishna Reddy">Dr. L V Muralikrishna Reddy, FIE, Int.

September 9, 1935 in relation to a State Charter of the emperor George V accepted. In the second paragraph of the declaration of the institution duties are described briefly as follows: "Indian engineers to meet the goals and objectives of the entity being established, they increase the general development of engineering and engineering science, their implementation in India and people associated with the organization and members of engineering related topics Information Adn-in providing facilities to receive and give ideas." The branches of this institution slowly began spreading across the country. Timely Mysore, Hyderabad, London, Punjab and open its center in Bombay. May 1943 Associate Membership exams began to be taken twice a year. In 1944, four major categories of technical operations were established. Civil, Micanikl (mechanical), electrical (electrical) and General (General) Engineering. Different for each department head has to be elected for a term of three years. The Silver Jubilee was celebrated in 1945 in Calcutta. Bihar in 1947, Mdhyprant, Sindh, Balochistan and Tiruwankur, these four locations open new centers.</li>

The IEI also has an autonomous organ, the <a href="/wiki/Engineering_Staff_College_of_India" title="Engineering Staff College of India">Engineering Staff College of India</a>.</li>
<li><b>Functions</b>: In addition to representing India in the Engineers Mobility Forum, the institution has been prominent in World Mining Congress (WMC), the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), the Commonwealth Engineers’ Council (CEC), the Fédération Internationale du Béton (fib), and the Federation of Engineering Institutions of South and Central Asia (FEISCA).
