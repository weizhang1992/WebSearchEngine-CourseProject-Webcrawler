<p>Irrigation systems were invented five to seven thousand years ago as a means of supplying water to agriculture-based societies. Aqueducts and irrigation systems were among the first forms of wastewater engineering. As population centers became more dense, they were used to remove sewage from settlements. The Romans were among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aqueduct. The Dark Ages marked a period where progress in water management came to a halt.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_history">Modern history</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wastewater_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Modern history">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>As populations grew, the management of human waste became a growing concern and a public health threat. By the 1850s in London more than 400,000 tons of sewage were flushed into the Thames River each day - around 150 million tons a year.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, typhus, cholera and typhoid were spread via the contaminated water supply.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> During the 19th century major cities started building sewage systems to remove human waste out of cities and into rivers.</p>
<p>During the 1900s the activated sludge process was invented.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The activated sludge process is a form of water purification that uses bacteria to consume human feces. Chlorine is used to kill off the bacteria.</p>
<p>Over the centuries much has changed in the field of wastewater engineering. Advancements in microbiology, chemistry, and engineering have drastically changed the field. Today wastewater engineers work on the collection of clean water for drinking, chemically treating it, and using UV light to kill off micro-organisms. They also treat <a href="/wiki/Water_Pollution" title="Water Pollution" class="mw-redirect">Water Pollution</a> in wastewater (blackwater and greywater) so that this water may be made safe for use without endangering the population and environment around it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_challenges:_climate_change">Modern challenges: climate change</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wastewater_engineering&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Modern challenges: climate change">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Today the wastewater managers confront new challenges and the need for new technology as water levels decrease due to increasingly frequent and extended droughts. Technologies such as sonar mapping are being used in wells to determine the volume of water that they can hold. For example the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of New York worked together to map underground aquifiers since the 1980s.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Today they have thorough maps of these aquifers to assist in water management.</p>
<p>Wastewater treatment contributes to global warming in many ways. One of the factors that contributes to global warming is wastewater treatment facilities and their emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of those gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases occur because of the decomposition of organic material from the anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria clean the leftover waste. Even if the anaerobic bacteria decomposition produces these gases, the percentage of greenhouse gases that other equipment produce is still greater than the contribution of the anaerobic bacteria. Also, the power usage from those machinery is very high. That is why many facilities are undergoing renovation to use higher levels of anaerobic bacteria compared to other types of equipment.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The effects of global warming on waste water treatment facilities vary from location to location. In the Northeast there has been increased rainfall causing treatment plants to be too small relative to the amount coming in. In the West there is a lack of rainfall and water sources are being depleted. This means the facilities will need to be updated to meet modern and future environmental changes such as the increased use of recycled and <a href="/wiki/Reclaimed_water" title="Reclaimed water">reclaimed water</a> Climate change also affects piping and increases the rate of corrosion, adding to facility cost.</p>
<p>Desalination plants may be required in the future for those regions hardest hit by water scarcity. Desalination is a process of cleaning water by means of evaporation. Water is evaporated and it passes through membranes. The water is then cooled and condenses allowing it to flow either back into the main water line or out to sea. Desalination is not completely "green" since the plants require energy to run and due to the fact that the brine waste must managed to avoid ecological damage to the ocean.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Formal education for wastewater engineers begins in high school with students taking classes such as chemistry, biology, physics, and higher mathematics including calculus. After high school most jobs require certification from a state agency. Those wanting to advance in the industry should pursue a civil engineering, <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_engineering" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical engineering</a>, environmental engineering, or a <a href="/wiki/Facilities_engineering" title="Facilities engineering">facilities engineering</a> degree. Gaining experience through internships and working while in college is a common pathway toward advancement.</p>
<p>Education about waste treatment requires course work in systems design, machinery design principles, water chemistry, and similar coursework. Other classes may include Chemistry of Plant Processes, and various plant operations courses.</p>
<p>Initial employment in wastewater engineering can be obtained by those with and without advanced formal education. The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), for example, shows how individuals can advance through a progression of certifications as Waste Water Treatment Operators.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The Board uses uses a five level classification system to classify water treatment facilities into categories I-V according to the population served and the complexity of the treatment system.</p>
<p>The Operator Certification requirements for water treatment operators and waste water treatment operators are described in detail by State law. To meet certification requirements, operators must submit an application to SWRCB, have the necessary work experience, meet the educational requirements, and pass an examination based on the knowledge, skill,and abilities described in the regulations. Operators are required to renew their certificates every three years. To be elibible for renewal, certified operators must complete a specified number of continuing education hours after the previous issuance of a certificate.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Wastewater engineers may advance in their careers through additional education and experience. With additional knowledge and experience one can become the manager of an entire plant. The accreditation body certifying the education for the degree and license is the <a href="/wiki/Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology" title="Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology" class="mw-redirect">Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a> (ABET). Over time some companies may require the wastewater engineer to continue their education to keep up with any changes in technology.</p>
<p>Obtaining one’s master's degree is encouraged since many companies list it as a preference in selection.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In this field 76 percent of those employed have a bachelor's degree, 17 percent have a master's degree and three percent have a post-doctoral degree as of 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-Onet_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Onet-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The average annual salary is approximately $83,360.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Wastewater engineers use a variety of skills and must have knowledge of mechanical and environmental engineering. They are required to perform tasks and demonstrate knowledge in design, mathematics, English, construction, physics, chemistry, biology, management, and personnel. Wastewater engineers must have skills in complex problem solving, critical thinking, mathematics, active listening, judgement, reading comprehension, speaking, writing, science, and system analysis.<sup id="cite_ref-Onet_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Onet-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Typical work activities include problem solving, communication with management and staff, gathering information, analyzing data, evaluating standards and complying with them, and communicating with others in the field.</p>
<p>Wastewater engineers perform these activities by combining their knowledge and skills to perform tasks. These tasks are to understand computer-aided design programs, and to conduct studies for the construction of facilities, water supply systems and collection systems. They may design systems for wastewater collection machinery, as well as system components. They may perform water flow analysis, then select designs and equipment based on government and industry standards.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
