<p>As with many other professions, the professional status and the actual practice of professional engineering is legally defined and protected by law. In some jurisdictions, only licensed engineers (sometimes called registered engineers) are permitted to "practice engineering," which requires careful definition in order to resolve potential overlap or ambiguity with respect to certain other professions which may or may not be themselves regulated (e.g. "scientists," or "architects"). Relatedly, jurisdictions that license according to particular engineering discipline need to define those boundaries carefully as well so that practitioners understand what they are permitted to do.</p>
<p>In many cases, only a licensed/registered engineer has the authority to take legal responsibility for engineering work or projects (typically via a seal or stamp on the relevant design documentation). Regulations may require that only a licensed or registered engineer can sign, seal, or stamp <a href="/wiki/Technical_documentation" title="Technical documentation">technical documentation</a> such as reports, plans, engineering drawings, and calculations for study estimate or valuation, or carry out design, analysis, repair, servicing, maintenance, or supervision of engineering work, process or project. In cases where public safety, property or welfare is concerned, it is most likely required that an engineer be licensed or registered — though some jurisdictions have an "industrial exemption" that permits engineers to work internally for an organization without licensure so long as they are not making final decisions to release product to the public or offering engineering services directly to the public (e.g. consultant).</p>
<p>Expert witness or opinion in courts or before government committees or commissions can only be given by a registered or licensed engineer. Engineering colleges generally prefer their faculty or professors to be licensed engineers.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Registration_and_regulation">Registration and regulation</span></h2>
<p>Becoming an engineer is a process that varies widely around the world. In some regions, use of the term ' engineer ' is regulated, in others it is not. Where engineering is a regulated profession, there are specific procedures and requirements for obtaining a registration, charter or license to practice engineering. These are obtained from the government or a charter-granting authority acting on its behalf, and engineers are subject to regulation by these bodies.<sup id="cite_ref-Layton_pp._6-7_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Layton_pp._6-7-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Licensed engineers enjoy significant influence over their regulation. They are often the authors of the pertinent codes of ethics used by some of these organizations.<sup id="cite_ref-Layton_pp._6-7_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Layton_pp._6-7-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Engineers in private practice most often find themselves in traditional professional-client relationships in their practice. Engineers employed in government service and government-run industry are on the other side of that relationship. Despite the different focus, engineers in industry and private practice face similar ethical issues and reach similar conclusions.<sup id="cite_ref-NSPE_Employment_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NSPE_Employment-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> One American engineering society, the <a href="/wiki/National_Society_of_Professional_Engineers" title="National Society of Professional Engineers">National Society of Professional Engineers</a> has sought to extend a single professional license and code of ethics for all engineers, regardless of practice area or employment sector.<sup id="cite_ref-Layton_pp._238-239_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Layton_pp._238-239-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h3>
<p>In the United States, registration or <a href="/wiki/Licensure" title="Licensure">licensure</a> of professional engineers and engineering practice is governed by the individual states. Each registration or license is valid only in the state where it is granted. Therefore, many professional engineers maintain licenses in more than one state. <a href="/wiki/Comity" title="Comity">Comity</a>, also known as reciprocity, between states allows engineers who are licensed or registered in one state to obtain a license in another state without meeting the ordinary rigorous proof of qualification by testing. This is accomplished by the second state recognizing the validity of the first state's licensing or registration process.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Requirements for licensing vary, but generally are as follows:<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>Graduate from an <a href="/wiki/Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology" title="Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology" class="mw-redirect">Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a> (ABET)-accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Engineering, Master of Science in Engineering, Master of Engineering) or, in some states, graduate from an ABET-accredited four-year college or university program with a degree in engineering technology.</li>
<li>Complete a standard <a href="/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Engineering_exam" title="Fundamentals of Engineering exam" class="mw-redirect">Fundamentals of Engineering</a> (FE) written examination, which tests applicants on breadth of understanding of basic engineering principles and, optionally, some elements of an engineering speciality. Completion of the first two steps typically qualifies applicants for certification in the U.S. as an <a href="/wiki/Engineer_in_training" title="Engineer in training" class="mw-redirect">engineer in training</a> (EIT), sometimes also called an engineer intern (EI).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Accumulate a certain amount of engineering experience: in most states the requirement is four years, but it is lower in some. For engineering technology graduates, the required number of years may be higher.</li>
<li>Complete a written <a href="/wiki/Principles_and_Practice_in_Engineering_Exam" title="Principles and Practice in Engineering Exam" class="mw-redirect">Principles and Practice in Engineering</a> (PE) examination, which tests the applicant's knowledge and skills in their chosen engineering discipline (civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, etc.), as well as <a href="/wiki/Engineering_ethics" title="Engineering ethics">engineering ethics</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For standardization, FE and PE exams are written and graded by a central organization, the <a href="/wiki/National_Council_of_Examiners_for_Engineering_and_Surveying" title="National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying">National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying</a> (NCEES). However, each state's board of professional engineers individually sets the requirements to take the exams, as well as the passing score. For example, applicants in some states must provide professional references from several PEs before they can take the PE exam. There is a fairly large range in exam pass rates for FE and PE exams, but the pass rate for repeat test takers is significantly lower.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>All 50 states and the District of Columbia have engineering boards that are represented on the NCEES, which administers both the FE and PE examinations.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Degree requirements in the United States are evolving. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the NCEES model will require additional credits beyond a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. NCEES is developing the types of creditable activities that will satisfy the additional educational requirement. This has received some support from civil engineers.<sup id="cite_ref-ASCE_MOE_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ASCE_MOE-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ACEC_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ACEC-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As of 2013, it is still possible for an individual to bypass Steps No. 2 and 4. In Texas, for example, both FE and PE exam waivers are still available to individuals with several years of creditable experience.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In a few states, it is still possible for an individual to bypass Step No. 1 and apply to take the registration examinations—as long as a PE sponsors the applicant—because work experience can be substituted for academic experience. The requirement for years of experience may also vary. For example, in California it is possible to take a PE examination with only two years of experience after a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree, or one year of experience after a Master of Engineering. Some states also have state-specific examinations, most notably California where there is a state-specific <a href="/wiki/Structural_engineering" title="Structural engineering">structural engineering</a> exam and two additional exams in <a href="/wiki/Land_surveying" title="Land surveying" class="mw-redirect">land surveying</a> and <a href="/wiki/Earthquake_engineering" title="Earthquake engineering">earthquake engineering</a> for civil engineering candidates.</p>
<p>Some states issue generic professional engineering licenses. Others, known as "discipline states", issue licenses for specific disciplines of engineering, such as <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_engineering" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_engineering" title="Nuclear engineering">nuclear engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chemical_engineering" title="Chemical engineering">chemical engineering</a>. However, in all cases engineers are ethically required to limit their practice to their area of competency, which is usually a small portion of a discipline. While licensing boards do not often enforce this limitation, it can be a factor in negligence lawsuits. In a few states, licensed civil engineers may also perform land surveys.</p>
<p>In addition to the person's license, most states require that firms providing engineering services are authorized to do so. For instance, the state of Florida issues a certificate of authorization to firms that are owned by a professional engineer.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" title="Civil engineering">Civil engineers</a> account for a large portion of licensed professional engineers. In Texas, for example, about 37 percent of licenses are for civil engineers, with civil engineering exams making up more than half of the exams taken.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Many of the remainder are <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_engineering" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">electrical</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Structural_engineering" title="Structural engineering">structural</a> engineers whose practice involves areas that states regulate, such as <a href="/wiki/HVAC" title="HVAC">HVAC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_engineering" title="Power engineering">electrical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plumbing" title="Plumbing">plumbing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fire_protection" title="Fire protection">fire protection</a> systems for buildings or public infrastructure. However, some engineers in other fields obtain licenses for the ability to serve as professional witnesses in courts, before government committees or just for prestige—even though they may never actually sign and seal design documents.</p>
<p>Since regulation of the practice of engineering is performed by the individual states in the U.S., areas of engineering involved in <a href="/wiki/Interstate_commerce" title="Interstate commerce" class="mw-redirect">interstate commerce</a> are essentially unregulated. These areas include much of <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_engineering" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aerospace_engineering" title="Aerospace engineering">aerospace</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chemical_engineering" title="Chemical engineering">chemical</a> engineering—and may be specifically exempted from regulation under an "industrial exemption." An industrial exemption covers engineers who design products such as automobiles that are sold (or have the potential to be sold) outside the state where they are produced, as well as the equipment used to produce the product. Structures subject to <a href="/wiki/Building_code" title="Building code">building codes</a> are not covered by an industrial exemption, though small residential buildings often do not require an engineer's seal. In many jurisdictions, the role of <a href="/wiki/Architects" title="Architects" class="mw-redirect">architects</a> and <a href="/wiki/Structural_engineers" title="Structural engineers" class="mw-redirect">structural engineers</a> overlap.</p>
<p>Many private companies employ non-degree workers in technical positions with engineering titles such as "test engineer" or "field engineer." At the company's discretion, such positions may not require an engineering degree.</p>
<p>However, it is important to make a distinction between a "graduate engineer" and a "professional engineer" or "licensed engineer." A "graduate engineer" is anyone holding a degree in engineering from an accredited four-year university program, but is not licensed to practice or offer services to the public. Unlicensed engineers usually work as employees for a company, or as professors in engineering colleges, where they are governed under the industrial exemption clause. Some states, such as Ohio and New Jersey, prohibit the use of the term "engineer" by an unlicensed person unless it is part of the internal classification of their employer.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s).

<p>In Canada the designation "professional engineer" can only be used by licensed engineers and the practice of engineering is protected in law and strictly enforced in all provinces.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2015)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The regulation and <a href="/wiki/Licensing" title="Licensing" class="mw-redirect">licensing</a> of engineers are accomplished through a self-governing body that is given the power to license and discipline professional engineers, as well as regulate the practice of the professional engineers in their province, such as <a href="/wiki/Professional_Engineers_Ontario" title="Professional Engineers Ontario">Professional Engineers Ontario</a>. A self-governing body's prime purpose is to protect the public. An engineering license and the award of the title "professional engineer" grants the right to practice as a professional engineer. Many of these associations are also responsible for regulating other related professions. The process for registration is generally as follows:</p>

<p>Professional engineers are not licensed in a specific discipline but are bound by their respective provincial code of ethics (e.g. in Ontario: Professional Engineers Act R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 941) from practicing beyond their training and experience. Breaches of the code are often sufficient grounds for enforcement measures, which may include the suspension or loss of license, and financial penalties. It could also result in serving time jail, should negligence be shown to have played a part in any incident that causes loss of human life.</p>
<p>Engineers are not tested on technical knowledge during the licensing process if their education was accredited by the CEAB. Accreditation of schools and their accredited degree granting status are monitored and controlled. This accreditation process is governed by <a href="/wiki/Engineers_Canada" title="Engineers Canada" class="mw-redirect">Engineers Canada</a> through their active group CEAB.</p>
<p>The accreditation process is continuous and enforced through regular accreditation reviews of each school. These reviews typically include the review of the school's curriculum (including marked final exams and assignments), interviews of current students, extracurricular activities and teaching staff as well additional areas the visiting board may feel need addressing. The specific areas considered are curriculum content, program environment and general criteria. The associations are granted both an exclusive right to title and an exclusive right to practice. There are only a few exceptions specifically noted in the acts—which do not include any "industrial exemptions." Therefore, a professional engineer is legally required to be registered. The level of enforcement varies depending on the specific industry. And, in some provinces, there is no requirement of having graduated from an accredited Canadian university in order to be a professional engineer.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The professional engineer's license is only valid in the province of delivery. There are, however, agreements between the associations to ease mobility. In 2009, professional engineers Ontario led an initiative to develop a national engineering licensing framework.</p>
<p>The term "engineer" is often used loosely in some Canadian industry sectors to describe people working in the field of engineering technology—not professional engineering—as engineering technologists or engineering technicians, and trades names such as stationary engineer. For example, the Canadian Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy often calls its technicians "marine engineers," "power engineers" and "military engineers" internally, but not in the public domain. The term "locomotive engineer" has been an integral part of the Canadian railroad since its inception. "<a href="/wiki/Stationary_engineers" title="Stationary engineers" class="mw-redirect">Stationary engineering</a>" is a trade whose technicians operate heavy machinery and equipment that provide heat, light, climate control and power.</p>

<p>In India, engineers with a bachelor's or master's degree in engineering or technology from a university are allowed to practice as consulting engineers—They must be licensed or registered with municipalities in order to submit public plans, designs or drawings for approval and record. The <a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Engineers_(India)" title="Institution of Engineers (India)">Institution of Engineers (India)</a> was granted British Royal Charter in 1935, and admits engineers holding the above degrees as a corporate member (AMIE) or chartered engineer [India]&#160;: C.Eng. [India].</p>
<p>IE(India) also offers registration as a professional engineer (PE [India]) and international professional engineer (PE [Int'l]) to member-engineers having seven years of active practical engineering experience after achieving their degrees. IE(India) is a member of IPEA (International Professional Engineers Agreement) with bilateral agreements with many national, foreign and international engineering institutions. Many municipalities exempt chartered engineers (PE[India] or PE [Int'l]) from their licensure or registration, by reciprocity (<a href="/wiki/Comity" title="Comity">comity</a>). All such consulting engineers must be licensed, registered or chartered regardless of their discipline or area of practice.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pakistan">Pakistan</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, engineering is a regulated discipline under <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Engineering_Council" title="Pakistan Engineering Council">Pakistan Engineering Council</a> via PEC Act 1976. Under this law, engineers with an engineering degree (BE/BSC/BS) from <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Engineering_Council" title="Pakistan Engineering Council">PEC</a> accredited universities/institutes are legally required to enroll with <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Engineering_Council" title="Pakistan Engineering Council">PEC</a>. Previously every engineering graduate was enrolled as professional engineer. To improve the quality of engineering profession, a two-tier system has been introduced via PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008. This system was realistically implemented starting 10 July 2010. Graduate engineers now enroll and practice as registered engineer (RE) in their general discipline of work. After at least 5 years of relevant work experience and accumulation of at least 17 CPD (Continued Professional Development) points, they may attempt the Engineering Practice Examination (EPE) conducted by <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Engineering_Council" title="Pakistan Engineering Council">PEC</a>. EPE is held by PEC biennially in major cities across the country. Those who pass the EPE are given the Prestigious Title of Professional Engineer in their specialized discipline of work.</p>
<p>PEC unilaterally honors the Engineers' Mobility Forum (EMF)/International Professional Engineers Agreement (IPEA). An engineer already registered as professional engineer with EMF will be exempt from EPE &amp; CPD points' requirement and will be awarded professional engineer's license (PE) on submission of application. This has been made possible through clause 13 (h) of PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008. To improve the quality of engineering services, engineers with professional engineer (PE) status are also required to engage in CPD activities in order to be able to retain their PE license. CPD points are awarded for various developmental activities such as formal education (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Postgraduate_diploma" title="Postgraduate diploma">PGD</a>, master or PhD), on-job experience, participating in conferences/workshops as audience, speaker or organizer, publications in technical journals, part-time teaching activities, serving as guest lecturer (other than full-time teaching) and serving as external examiner for master/PhD thesis.</p>
<p>For CPD points system, upper limit of points has also been implemented to prevent abuse of the system and encourage balanced participation in various CPD activities. In case of on-job work experience which is the primary engagement of engineering profession, one CPD point is awarded for 400 hours of work. Upper limit of 2 credit points per year has been established for on-job work experience. Rewarding only 800 hours (~4 months full-time) of work per year has many benefits including inherent tolerance for bouts of unemployment, in-built allowance for sickness/disease/injury, discouraging workaholism, enabling full-time engineering teachers to gain relevant field experience with reduced time commitment (e.g. part-time consulting engagement) and encouraging participation in other CPD activities which further the engineering profession (e.g. guest lectures, publishing research, authoring a book and social work for engineers under recognized engineers' associations).</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, PEC CPD Bye-Laws 2008 introduced the legal term "registered person". Registered person is a term distinct from registered engineer (RE). It is a blanket term used for all persons enrolled with PEC in any capacity — whether as registered engineers (RE) or professional engineers (PE).</p>

<p>The European Engineer (Eur Ing, EUR ING) is an international <a href="/wiki/Professional_certification" title="Professional certification">professional qualification</a> for engineers used in many European countries. The title is granted after successful application to a national member of the <a href="/wiki/European_Federation_of_National_Engineering_Associations" title="European Federation of National Engineering Associations">European Federation of National Engineering Associations</a> (FEANI), which includes representation from many European countries, including much of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. It allows a person who has an engineering degree and usually an engineering professional qualification in one of the member countries to use the qualification in others, but this depends on local legislation.</p>
<p>The title Eur Ing is "<a href="/wiki/Pre-nominal" title="Pre-nominal" class="mw-redirect">pre-nominal</a>," i.e., it is placed before rather than after the name as in the case of a post-nominal title such as those for academic degrees (however, in some EU countries, academic degrees are also pre-nominal). Names are also placed on the <i>FEANI Register</i> maintained by FEANI in additional to national member registers.</p>
<p>Another association in Europe is The EurEta. The professional title "Ing. EurEta" is used as a pre-nominal (similar to Dr. or Prof). An engineer registered with EurEta "European Higher Engineering and Technical Professionals Association" is called an "EurEta Registered Engineer," and has the right to use this title in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Germany">Germany</span></h4>
<p>In Germany academic title <i>Dipl.-Ing.</i> (diplom-ingenieur, diploma engineer) is awarded by the educational ministries of the federal states (the Bundesländer) after having completed an academic <a href="/wiki/Engineering_education" title="Engineering education">engineering education</a> according to the German engineer's law (ingenieurgesetz); however, it is not a license to practice engineering, rather an academic title. The degrees Ing. grad. (graduierter ingenieur, graduate engineer) and obering (oberingenieur, supervisor engineer) are no longer awarded. The designation Dipl.-Ing. is recognized by FEANI as a precursor for registration as Eur Ing. "Dipl.-Ing." does not confer licensing by the government, and therefore is not equivalent to the steps of licensing (e.g., mandatory references, minimum work experience and a second theoretical and practical exam) conducted in other countries such as the U.K., Canada or the United States.</p>
<p>The <i>state-certified engineer</i> is a European Union qualification for a professional engineer of technology or professional engineering technologist—not to be confused with an engineering technician or Dipl.-Ing). It is granted to engineering technologists upon successful completion of a technical college and it is also granted by an international organization with headquarters in Germany, the Bundesverband höherer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V. ("Federal Association of Higher Professions for Technology, Economy and Design") or BVT.</p>

<p>A member of the BVT is entitled to use the initials BVT after his name. To achieve this qualification, it is required to complete a 42-month apprenticeship program, a minimum 2,400 hour college diploma in engineering or technology, two years of relevant experience and pass the state examination. The academic requirement to be a state-certified engineer is a degree equivalent to <i>level 6 on EQF = bachelor</i> on the European Qualification Framework. A bachelor's (honors) degree in engineering or engineering technology from an accredited university is also equated to level 6 on EQF. A state-certified engineer is not required to complete a university degree. Before Jan. 31, 2012, a state-certified engineer certificate usually qualified the holder to proceed to bachelor's level education at a university of applied science. In the past, this led to wide and controversial discussions between bachelor's and master's degrees engineers and state-certified engineers.</p>
<p>Today, this is on the same level as a bachelor's degree. One can continue to study to a master's degree with the SCE qualification. The academic requirements for qualification are similar to incorporated engineer qualification/registration by EC UK. State-certified engineers now assist engineers with only a diploma or master's degree. They are also holding full engineering positions as systems engineers, integration engineers, test engineers, QA engineers, etc.</p>
<p>State-certified engineer, business manager and designer levels are now a level 6–Bachelor on DQF and EQF, as of Jan. 31, 2012. The following top representatives and agents institutions were involved: federal government (Federal Ministry for Education and Research, Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology), standing conference and economic ministerial meeting of countries, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, German Trade Union Federation and the Federal Institute for Vocational Application. They agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF, as a German qualifications framework (DQR).</p>

<p>In Canada it is illegal to practice engineering, or use the title "professional engineer", without a license. Engineering in Canada is regulated in the public interest by self-governing professional licensing bodies. These bodies were established by Canada's 13 provincial and territorial governments through legislation. The provincial and territorial governments have delegated their constitutional authority to regulate engineers and engineering in Canada to professional licensing bodies that are maintained and governed by the profession, creating a system of self-regulation.</p>
<p>The first law related to professional engineering in Ontario was created in 1922 and allowed for the creation of a voluntary association to oversee registration of engineers. The Act of 1922 was "open", meaning that membership in the association was not mandatory for practising engineers. In Ontario, regulation of engineering practice dates to 1937, when the Professional Engineers Act was amended and the engineering profession was "closed" to non-qualified individuals; that is, licensure was made mandatory for anyone practising professional engineering. The provincial government determined that it would be in the public interest to restrict the practice of engineering to those who were qualified, and the right to practice was "closed" to non-engineers as a result of the failures of bridges and buildings, which had been designed by unskilled individuals.</p>
<p>Canadian provinces legally allow engineers to self-regulate their profession. The licensing bodies fulfil this mandate by ensuring standards of engineering practice and education in Canada, by setting standards for admission into the profession, by disciplining engineers who fail to uphold the profession's practice and ethical standards, and by preventing the misuse of the title professional engineer by individuals who are not licensed members of the profession. They also take appropriate action to prevent the illegal practice of engineering by unlicensed individuals. Each licensing body's mandate and obligation to undertake this role is laid out in the act that created it. Although each act is slightly different, most also define a scope of practice for engineers and specifically restrict the use of the title professional engineer to individuals who have been licensed by the engineering licensing body in the province or territory where the act applies.</p>
<p>The use of the term engineer was an issue between professional bodies, the IT industry, and the security industry, where companies or associations may issue certifications or titles with the word engineer as part of that title (such as <a href="/wiki/Security_engineer" title="Security engineer" class="mw-redirect">security engineer</a> or <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Certified_Systems_Engineer" title="Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer" class="mw-redirect">Microsoft certified systems engineer</a>). Microsoft has since changed the title to "Microsoft Certified IT Professional". Several licensing bodies for professional engineering contend that only licensed professional engineers are legally allowed to use the title engineer. The IT industry, on the other hand, counters that:</p>
<ol>
<li>These title holders never presented themselves as professional engineers</li>
<li>Provincial laws, other than in Quebec and Ontario, regulate only the use of term professional engineer, and not any title with the word engineer; in Quebec and Ontario, the term engineer is protected by both the Engineers Act<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> and by Section 32 of the Professional Code<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>The IT industry has used the term engineer since the dawn of the computing industry in the 60s.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Court rulings regarding the usage of the term engineer have been mixed. For example, after complaints were lodged by the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Council_of_Professional_Engineers" title="Canadian Council of Professional Engineers">Canadian Council of Professional Engineers</a>, a court in <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> fined <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Canada" title="Microsoft Canada" class="mw-redirect">Microsoft Canada</a> $1,000 for misusing the "engineer" title by referring to MCSE graduates as engineers.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Conversely, an Alberta court dismissed the lawsuit filed by The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists, and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA) against Raymond Merhej for using the title "system engineer," claiming that, 'The respondent's situation is such that it cannot be contended that the public is likely to be deceived, confused or jeopardized by his use of the term...'"<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> APEGGA also lost the appeal to this decision.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Canadian Information Processing Society,<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> and in particular CIPS Ontario,<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> have attempted to strike a balance between the professional engineering licensing bodies and the IT industry over the use of the term engineer in the software industry, but so far no major agreements or decisions have been announced.</p>
<p>Additional confusion has taken place over similarly-named occupations. One such example is power engineers or stationary engineers. Graduates of a two-year college level power engineering technology program in Nova Scotia may use the title power engineer or stationary engineer. This conflicts with the title often used in the electrical industry for professional engineers who design related equipment and can cause confusion.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States_2">United States</span></h3>
<p>In the United States, most states prohibit unlicensed persons from calling themselves an "engineer" or indicating branches or specialities not covered by the licensing acts.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>The title "engineer" is legally protected in many states, meaning that it is unlawful to use it to offer engineering services to the public unless permission, certification, or other official endorsement is specifically granted by that state, through a professional engineering license, an "industrial exemption", or certain other non-engineering titles such as "operating engineer".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Employees of state or federal agencies may also call themselves engineers if that term appears in their official job title. The <a href="/wiki/IEEE" title="IEEE" class="mw-redirect">IEEE</a>'s formal position on this is as follows: "The title, engineer, and its derivatives should be reserved for those individuals whose education and experience qualify them to practice in a manner that protects public safety. Strict use of the title serves the interest of both the IEEE-USA and the public by providing a recognized designation by which those qualified to practice engineering may be identified."<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> It is generally a requirement in the United States to have at least a Bachelor of Science degree in an engineering discipline or related applied science to be considered an engineer and practice as such.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>A business generally cannot offer engineering services to the public or have a name that implies that it does so unless it employs at least one professional engineer.</p>
<p>Due to industrial exemption many non-professional engineers are titled as engineers. Examples are <a href="/wiki/Production_engineer" title="Production engineer" class="mw-redirect">production engineer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Test_engineer" title="Test engineer">test engineer</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Integration_engineer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Integration engineer (page does not exist)">integration engineer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Network_engineer" title="Network engineer" class="mw-redirect">network engineer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Project_engineer" title="Project engineer" class="mw-redirect">project engineer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineer" title="Systems engineer" class="mw-redirect">systems engineer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sales_engineer" title="Sales engineer" class="mw-redirect">sales engineer</a>.</p>
<p>This is seen in engineering job advertisements on line and in news papers, most of the advertisements and employers don't require licensing due to the industrial exemption.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>In the United States, use of the title professional engineer is restricted to those holding a professional engineer's license. These people have the right to add the letters PE after their names on resumes, business cards and other communication. However, each state has its own licensing procedure, and the license is valid only in the state that granted it.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>Other uses of the term engineer are legally controlled and protected to varying degrees, dependent on the state and the enforcement of its engineering certification board. The term is frequently applied to fields where practitioners may have no engineering background, or the work has no basis in the physical engineering disciplines; for example <a href="/wiki/Sanitation_engineer" title="Sanitation engineer" class="mw-redirect">sanitation engineer</a>. However, in many jurisdictions, the usage of this term is limited to internal use by a company, rather than in a professional or marketing aspect, if said company is not licensed to perform engineering work. This is because what is legally recognized as engineering work (and thus requiring licensure to be practiced) is held to strict criminal liability.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the term "<a href="/wiki/Software_engineer" title="Software engineer">software engineer</a>", many states, such as Texas and Florida, have license requirements for such a title that are in line with the requirements for more traditional engineering fields.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom_2">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>Engineering in the UK is not a licensed profession. In the UK, the term "engineer" is often applied to non-degreed vocations such as technologists, technicians, draftsmen, machinists, mechanics, plumbers, electricians, repair people, and semi-skilled occupations. Many of these occupations adopt the term "engineer", "professional engineer", "registered engineer", "gas engineer", "heating engineer", "drainage engineer", "automobile engineer", "aircraft engineer" and many hundreds of derivatives. British Gas describe their installation and maintenance mechanics as registered professional engineers. Most members of the UK public perceive the engineer and engineering as a semi-skilled trade and is often looked down upon with disdain. The work and identity of UK Chartered Engineers is often styled as science and scientists by the UK media causing public confusion. There are a few fields of practice, generally safety related, which are reserved by statute to licensed persons.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Engineering_Council_UK" title="Engineering Council UK" class="mw-redirect">Engineering Council UK</a> grants the titles "chartered engineer," "incorporated engineer," "engineering technician" and "information and communications technology technician." It also declares them to be "professional engineers."<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> The incorporated engineer is an engineer, as declared by the Engineering Council of the United Kingdom and the European definition of title under 2005/36/EC.<sup id="cite_ref-Engineer_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Engineer-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> UK incorporated engineers are recognized internationally through the Sydney Accord academic agreement as engineering technologists.</p>
<p><b>According to the European Union's European Commission, chartered engineer is a regulated profession</b> <sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Competent authorities are responsible to take a decision when a professional from another member state wants to practice this regulated profession. In case of provision of service, the declaration must be sent to the U.K. Engineering Council prior to the provisioning of services.</p>
<p>All chartered and incorporated engineers in the U.K. are members of an engineering institution usually aligned with their undergraduate degree (mechanical, civil, chemical, electrical, aeronautical etc.). There are various levels of membership (including student, associate, member, fellow) with designation letters.</p>
<p>An example is Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (<a href="/wiki/Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology" title="Institution of Engineering and Technology" class="mw-redirect">MIET</a>) (formerly Institution of Electrical Engineers). This category is open to professional engineers with suitable qualifications and involvement in areas relevant to the interests of the institution. <b>MIET</b> is a regulated professional title recognized in Europe by Directive 2005/36.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> MIET is listed on the part 2 professions regulated by professional bodies incorporated by Royal Charter-Statutory Instruments 2007 No. 2781 Professional Qualifications-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The U.K. has other "professional" engineering titles registered via the <a href="/wiki/Engineering_Council_UK" title="Engineering Council UK" class="mw-redirect">Engineering Council UK</a> (ECUK): incorporated engineer (IEng) and chartered engineer (CEng).<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Incorporated engineer is a first-cycle qualification for <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Engineering" title="Bachelor of Engineering">Bachelor of Engineering</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science" title="Bachelor of Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree holders (Sydney Accord, equivalent to technologist). Chartered engineer is a second-cycle qualification usually reserved for holders of integrated <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Engineering" title="Master of Engineering">Master of Engineering</a> degrees. Both IEng and CEng require substantial professional experience (4–8 years post graduate), a professional review and an interview.</p>
<p>It is illegal in the U.K. to hold that one is a chartered or incorporated engineer unless so registered with the Engineering Council. The title of "engineer" by itself is not regulated in the U.K.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>While the <a href="/wiki/Engineering_Council" title="Engineering Council">Engineering Council</a> is the primary body registering engineers in U.K., there are other professional societies that register engineers as well. Under its royal charter, Engineering Council grants licenses to engineering institutions allowing them to assess candidates for inclusion on its register of professional engineers and technicians, and to accredit academic programs and professional development schemes. There are more than 30 institutions licensed to register professional engineers with the Engineering Council.</p>
<p>Candidates can become a chartered engineer (CEng) or incorporated engineer (IEng) in the U.K. through programs administered by the City and Guilds London Institute. These programs lead to a City and Guilds graduate diploma in engineering and to a post-graduate diploma in engineering. They are recognized by IET for registration as CEng and IEng.</p>

<li>In Germany and some other European and Latin American countries, the term diploma engineer implies that the person has completed typically one year of academic work beyond the basic Bachelor of Engineering degree, and completed a major academic project, similar to a master's thesis. Therefore, a diploma engineer is a university degree, and not a professional registration or license. However, in Germany and most other countries where the diploma engineer degree exist, there is no professional registration or license in engineering (with a very limited number of exceptions, such as civil engineering in Germany). For this reason, graduates holding these degrees are generally allowed to use the legally protected title of "engineer" within these countries. In Germany the usage of the term engineer (ingenieur) as such, not just the diplom-ingenieur, is protected by various länder (<a href="/wiki/States_of_Germany" title="States of Germany">states of Germany</a>) laws—because education matters are governed by the legislation of the länder, not the federal government.

Second, ingeniería, which requires a major degree in basic sciences plus a technical degree, both from a university (usually five years total). Third, ingeniería civil, which requires an academic major degree in basic sciences, a minor degree in applied sciences and a technical degree, all from a university (usually six or six and a half years total).
